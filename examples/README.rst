Cymetric Use-case Examples
===========================

This directory has Python scripts that show a new user how to employ cymetric,
pandas, matplotlib, and numpy together to do fuel cycle analysis work. 

Assuming all dependencies are satisfied and one is within this directory, these
scripts can be run simply:

.. code-block:: bash
    
    $ python script_of_choice.py

These scripts use the included database, ``recycle.sqlite``. The input file (``recycle.xml``) is also included for
your convenience.
